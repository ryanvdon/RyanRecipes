				<p>Tonightʼs variation on the beloved Italian-American dish gets its “devilish” heat from Calabrian chile paste, mixed into a tangy-sweet tomato sauce. It perfectly coats shrimp, cabbage, and lumaca rigata pasta. A garnish of sliced almonds finishes the dish with contrasting crunch. </p>

						Prepare the ingredients:
					</h3>
					1. Fill a medium pot with water; add a big pinch of salt and heat to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut out and discard the core of the cabbage; thinly slice the leaves. Peel and roughly chop the garlic.

				<div>
					2. Pat the shrimp dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper. In a medium pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned shrimp; cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until opaque and cooked through. Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a plate. Set aside in a warm place.

					3. Add the sliced cabbage to the pan of reserved fond; season with salt and pepper. (If the pan seems dry, add a drizzle of olive oil.) Cook on mediumhigh, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add the verjus and 1/4 cup of water; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally and scraping up any fond, 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cabbage has softened and the water has cooked off. Transfer to the plate of cooked shrimp. Wipe out the pan.

					4. While the cabbage cooks, add the pasta to the pot of boiling water. Cook, stirring occasionally, 9 to 11 minutes, or until al dente (still slightly firm to the bite). Reserving 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, drain thoroughly.

					5. While the pasta cooks, in the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the chopped garlic; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until softened and fragrant. Add the tomato sauce, 1/3 cup of water, and as much of the chile paste as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 4 to 5 minutes, or until thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

					Finish &amp; serve your dish:
					</h3>
					6. Add the cooked pasta, cooked shrimp and cabbage, and half the reserved pasta cooking water to the pan. Cook, stirring vigorously, 1 to 2 minutes, or until coated. (If the sauce seems dry, gradually add the remaining pasta cooking water to achieve your desired consistency.) Turn off the heat; stir in the crème fraîche until thoroughly combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Top the finished pasta with the almonds and a drizzle of olive oil. Enjoy!
